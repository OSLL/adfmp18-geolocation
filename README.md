## Scenarios
(Here we keep in mind that our user is an active person, most likely a tourist.)

1. The user (let's call them N.) walks in the city and wants to explore a bit.
  * N. opens the App.
  * On the main screen N. presses the "Play" button.
  * The app chooses the photo of a place in a walkable distance from N., 
  and displays a half of it on the screen. 
  The second half of the screen comes from the camera.
  There is an option to dismiss a task if the user does not like it.
  * The app measures the time it took N. to get the picture, precision 
  (how well the photo N. made matches the initial one), and also tracks 
  the N.'s location. In case N. goes suspiciously far from the taret location,
  the app will display a hint
  * N. successfully finishes the task. The statistics are recorded, 
  the picture is added to the Gallery.
  
2. N. wants to see how nice their performance is / show their results to friends or relatives.
  * N. opens the App.
  * On the main screen N. presses the "Stats" / "Gallery" button. 
  The results are displayed.
  * To go back to the main screen, they press the "Menu" button.
